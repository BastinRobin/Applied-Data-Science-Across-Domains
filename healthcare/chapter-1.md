# Predict Presence Of Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

## Problem
Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world. The healthcare industry is no exception. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.

In this usecase, we will be predicting potential Heart Diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms. The algorithms included K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. The dataset has been taken from Kaggle. My complete project is available at Heart Disease Prediction.
