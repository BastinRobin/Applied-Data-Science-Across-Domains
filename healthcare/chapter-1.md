# Predict Presence Of Heart Disease 
## Problem
Heart diseases is a term covering any disorder of the heart. Heart diseases have become a major concern to deal with as studies show that the number of deaths due to heart diseases have increased significantly over the past few decades in India, in fact, it has become the leading cause of death in India.

Can we predict the presence of one of four types of heart disease(or none at all) using a patient's medical test report data.


## Solution Guideline

A study shows that from 1990 to 2016 the death rate due to heart diseases have increased around 34 percent from 155.7 to 209.1 deaths per one lakh population in India. Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world. The healthcare industry is no exception. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.


## Data Sources
We have Heart disease data set consists of patient data from Cleveland, Hungary, Long Beach, and Switzerland. The combined dataset consists of 14 features and 916 samples with many missing values.

## Data Exploration
Based on the given dataset lets explore each column and value metrics of each column.

- `age`: The patients age in years
- `sex`: The patients gender(`1 = male` and `0 = female`)
- `cp`: Chest pain type, `Value 1`: typical angina `Value 2`: atypical angina `Value 3`: non-anginal pain `Value 4`: asymptomatic
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (in `mm Hg` on admission to the hospital)
- `chol`: Serum cholestoral in `mg/dl`
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > `120 mg/dl`(`1 = true`; `0 = false`)
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results `Value 0`: normal `Value 1`: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) `Value 2`: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Chest pain(angina) after exercise? (`1 = yes` and `0 = no`)
- `thal`: Not described `Value 3`: normal `Value 6`: treated defect `Value 7`: reversible defect
- `num`: Target `Value 0`: less than 50% narrowing of coronary arteries(no heart disease) `Value 1,2,3,4`: `>50% narrowing`. The value indicates the stage of heart disease
