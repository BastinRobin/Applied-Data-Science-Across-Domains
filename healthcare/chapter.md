# Hospital Readmission for Patients with Diabetes

## Problem statement
Diabetes is a condition in which there is too much glucose (a type of sugar) in the blood. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the body's organs. Possible complications include damage to large (macrovascular) and small (microvascular) blood vessels, which can lead to heart attack, stroke, and problems with the kidneys, eyes, gums, feet and nerves. 

## Key findings
Risk of most diabetes-related complications can be reduced by keeping blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels within recommended range. Also, being a healthy weight, eating healthily, reducing alcohol intake, and not smoking will help reduce your risk. 

Regular check-ups and screening are important to pick up any problems early.

As the healthcare system moves toward value-based care, CMS has created many programs to improve the quality of care of patients. One of these programs is called the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program ([HRRP](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/Value-Based-Programs/HRRP/Hospital-Readmission-Reduction-Program.html)), which reduces reimbursement to hospitals with above average readmissions. For those hospitals which are currently penalized under this program, one solution is to create interventions to provide additional assistance to patients with increased risk of readmission. But how do we identify these patients? We can use predictive modeling from data science to help prioritize patients.

One patient population that is at increased risk of hospitalization and readmission is that of diabetes. Diabetes is a medical condition that affects approximately 1 in 10 patients in the United States. According to Ostling et al, patients with diabetes have almost double the chance of being hospitalized than the general population ([Ostling et al 2017](https://clindiabetesendo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40842-016-0040-x)). Therefore, in this article, I will focus on predicting hospital readmission for patients with diabetes.

In this usecase we will explore how to build a model predicting readmission in Python.
